# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Seth and Tom had hired me to support their election campaign data analysis for the state of Colorado. We needed to prepare the election results and data to the state so they could perform an audit to announce the official winner. The stat were looking for the following information with in analysis: 

1. Total votes across the counties.

2. The total votes broke out be county and the % each county had in relation to the total votes within all counties.

3. Which county had the most voters participate.

4. Candidate breakout showing how many votes each candidate received and what their total votes percentage aligned to the total votes captured.

5. The winner based on all votes from the different counties showing the winners name, total votes they received and the percentage of votes to the total votes for all candidates.
